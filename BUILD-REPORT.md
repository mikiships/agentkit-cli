# BUILD-REPORT.md — agentkit-cli v1.9.0 resolve loop

Date: 2026-04-20
Builder: OpenClaw subagent execution pass
Contract: all-day-build-contract-agentkit-cli-v1.9.0-release.md
Status: SHIPPED

## Summary

Added a deterministic `agentkit resolve` lane that consumes the shipped `source -> source-audit -> map -> contract -> bundle -> taskpack -> clarify` workflow plus an answers file, then emits one stable resolved packet with answered questions folded in, remaining blockers called out, assumption updates recorded, and an updated execution recommendation.

## Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-------|
| D1 | Deterministic resolve engine + schema | ✅ Complete | Added `agentkit_cli/resolve.py` with stable markdown/JSON rendering and deterministic ordering for answers, blockers, follow-ups, and assumption updates |
| D2 | CLI workflow + actionable rendering | ✅ Complete | Added `agentkit resolve <path> --answers <file>` with `--json`, `--output`, and `--output-dir` support |
| D3 | End-to-end resolution loop validation | ✅ Complete | Added focused workflow coverage for full-lane resolve success plus incomplete-answer and contradiction pause paths |
| D4 | Release-readiness pass | ✅ Complete | Bumped version metadata to `1.9.0`, reconciled local docs/report surfaces, and re-ran final contradiction and hygiene checks |
| D5 | Git release surfaces | ✅ Complete | Pushed `feat/v1.9.0-resolve-loop` to origin, created annotated tag `v1.9.0`, and verified both remote refs peel to `8a2c7197cfc0e4199aa2a7f18c9f1b3092932c84` |
| D6 | PyPI publish + final reconciliation | ✅ Complete | Built `dist/` artifacts, published `agentkit-cli==1.9.0`, verified the live registry artifacts, and reconciled final shipped chronology |

## Validation

- focused resolve workflow slice at release commit `8a2c7197cfc0e4199aa2a7f18c9f1b3092932c84`: `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_resolve.py tests/test_resolve_cmd.py tests/test_resolve_workflow.py tests/test_clarify.py tests/test_clarify_cmd.py tests/test_clarify_workflow.py tests/test_bundle.py tests/test_taskpack.py tests/test_source_audit_workflow.py tests/test_contract_d2.py tests/test_main.py tests/test_daily_d5.py` -> `52 passed in 2.11s`
- full suite at release commit `8a2c7197cfc0e4199aa2a7f18c9f1b3092932c84`: `uv run --python 3.11 --with pytest --with fastapi --with uvicorn --with httpx pytest -q` -> `4870 passed, 1 warning in 141.11s (0:02:21)`
- release contradiction scan: `bash /Users/mordecai/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/pre-action-recall.sh release agentkit-cli /Users/mordecai/repos/agentkit-cli-v1.9.0-resolve-loop && bash /Users/mordecai/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/check-status-conflicts.sh /Users/mordecai/repos/agentkit-cli-v1.9.0-resolve-loop` -> no contradictory success or blocker narratives found
- git release proof: `git push -u origin feat/v1.9.0-resolve-loop` succeeded; at release time `git ls-remote --heads origin feat/v1.9.0-resolve-loop` and `git ls-remote --tags origin refs/tags/v1.9.0^{}` both returned `8a2c7197cfc0e4199aa2a7f18c9f1b3092932c84`; after final docs reconciliation the branch head advanced to docs-only commit `fb6de180085338d6bacf61d071781632c565d5d0` while the shipped tag remained pinned to the tested release commit
- build artifacts: `uv build` -> `dist/agentkit_cli-1.9.0.tar.gz` (1099350 bytes) and `dist/agentkit_cli-1.9.0-py3-none-any.whl` (617854 bytes)
- PyPI publish: `twine upload dist/agentkit_cli-1.9.0.tar.gz dist/agentkit_cli-1.9.0-py3-none-any.whl` -> success, view at `https://pypi.org/project/agentkit-cli/1.9.0/`
- registry verification: `https://pypi.org/project/agentkit-cli/1.9.0/` returned `HTTP/2 200`; `https://pypi.org/pypi/agentkit-cli/1.9.0/json` returned `HTTP/2 200` and listed both `agentkit_cli-1.9.0.tar.gz` and `agentkit_cli-1.9.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- hygiene check: `bash /Users/mordecai/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/post-agent-hygiene-check.sh /Users/mordecai/repos/agentkit-cli-v1.9.0-resolve-loop` -> passed with no findings

## Current release truth

- `pyproject.toml`, `agentkit_cli/__init__.py`, and `uv.lock` agree on `1.9.0`
- The supported handoff lane is now `source -> source-audit -> map -> contract -> bundle -> taskpack -> clarify -> resolve`
- Release commit: `8a2c7197cfc0e4199aa2a7f18c9f1b3092932c84`
- Current branch head after final docs reconciliation: `origin/feat/v1.9.0-resolve-loop` -> `fb6de180085338d6bacf61d071781632c565d5d0` (docs-only follow-up)
- Annotated tag: `v1.9.0` -> `8a2c7197cfc0e4199aa2a7f18c9f1b3092932c84`
- Focused resolve validation is green on the shipped release commit
- Full supported pytest validation is green on the shipped release commit: `4870 passed, 1 warning in 141.11s (0:02:21)`
- PyPI `agentkit-cli==1.9.0` is live with both the wheel and sdist artifacts
- This pass reached truthful `SHIPPED` state
