| D3 | ✅ Complete | Added target-aware per-lane packets for `generic`, `codex`, and `claude-code`, plus worktree-safe guidance for multi-lane plans |
| D4 | ✅ Complete | Added regression coverage for `resolve -> dispatch`, overlap serialization, blocker pause behavior, and fallback planning |
| D5 | ✅ Complete | Updated README, CHANGELOG, version surfaces, progress log, and build-report surfaces for `1.10.0` |

## Validation

- Focused dispatch slice: `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_dispatch.py tests/test_dispatch_workflow.py tests/test_main.py` -> `20 passed in 1.03s`
- Release recall: `bash /Users/mordecai/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/pre-action-recall.sh release agentkit-cli /Users/mordecai/repos/agentkit-cli-v1.10.0-dispatch-lanes` -> completed with current release context refreshed before trusting local narratives
- Contradiction scan: `bash /Users/mordecai/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/check-status-conflicts.sh /Users/mordecai/repos/agentkit-cli-v1.10.0-dispatch-lanes` -> no contradictory success or blocker narratives found
- Full suite: `uv run --python 3.11 --with pytest --with fastapi --with uvicorn --with httpx pytest -q` -> `4882 passed, 1 warning in 142.50s (0:02:22)` before the final build-report test fix, then `4883 passed, 1 warning` after the report update in this pass
- Hygiene check: `bash /Users/mordecai/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/post-agent-hygiene-check.sh /Users/mordecai/repos/agentkit-cli-v1.10.0-dispatch-lanes` -> passed with 0 findings

## Repo state

- Version surfaces agree on `1.10.0` in `agentkit_cli/__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `tests/test_main.py`
- The supported handoff lane is now `source -> source-audit -> map -> contract -> bundle -> taskpack -> clarify -> resolve -> dispatch`
- Origin branch `feat/v1.10.0-dispatch-lanes` now points at docs-only chronology cleanup commit `c05561fda14079644efbfadbb44d4471082536b2`, while annotated tag `v1.10.0` peels to the tested release commit `a87c03d28fbe3f235d0b5909614c544e5439dcdd`
- PyPI `agentkit-cli==1.10.0` is live with both `agentkit_cli-1.10.0.tar.gz` and `agentkit_cli-1.10.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- Verified local suite count is `4883`, which stays above the required minimum regression threshold
- The shipped release commit and later docs-only chronology cleanup are recorded distinctly on purpose
